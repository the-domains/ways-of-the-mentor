Ways of the Mentor was launched in February
2013 by Mulga Gidgee. Workshops have now been held in Darwin and Arnhem Land NT, with
participants from CDEP, Childcare Facilities, Councils, Indigenous
corporations, government departments, charities and schools.

An outline of the day is below:

A Practical Guide to being an Effective
Mentor 

With a particular focus on mentoring in
cross-cultural environments, this one-day workshop explores:

Getting started

The mentoring process

Mentoring plans

Getting there -- the Ways of The Mentor Toolbox

Know yourself

Sharing

Challenging

Cultural competency

Mentoring for emotional intelligence

The workshop combines brief lectures with
structured interactions to allow participants to practice and refine specific
mentoring skills. The workshop includes the opportunity to identify mentoring
strengths and weaknesses, interact with other mentors, and develop specific,
core competencies for effective mentoring.

Mulga Gidgee also happily hosts the [NT
